# How to use:

- rename the file to bisrv.asd
- make sure the bootloader fix has been applied to the SF2000
- copy bisrv.asd to /bios on a known working SD card
- turn on SF2000

## Notes:

- these are retroarch builds with a single libretro core each
- settings and other files will be written to /retroarch on the SD card
- the SF2000 may run warm/hot when using these; short tests are recommended
- use at your own risk!
